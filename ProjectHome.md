Using LCMS data deconvoluted by Decon2LS, we built a list of unique neutral masses corresponding to candidate glycan compositions summarized over their various charge states, adducts and range of elution times.  Our work aims to provide confident identification of true compounds in complex data sets that are not amenable to manual interpretation.  This capability is an essential part of glycomics work flows.  We demonstrate this tool, GlycreSoft, using an LC/MS dataset on tissue derived heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.
